# VUEJS MASTERY PROJECT

This project was started to learn the basics of Vue.js through the [Vue Mastery Courses(https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/communicating-events).
It is not complete, and it was only made for personal learning purposes. This project is put here as an archive for my personal records.
